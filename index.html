    A chicken is a bird. One of the features that differentiate it from most other birds is that it has a comb and two wattles. The comb is the red appendage on the top of the head, and the wattles are the two appendages under the chin. These are secondary
    sexual characteristics and are more prominent in the male. Day old chicks can be purchased from hatcheries or feedstores. Chicks that are sold as a “straight run” will be a mixture
of pullets (females) and cockerels (males). To buy only pullets, make sure the chicks are sexed. Before you purchase a
rooster, make sure the regulations in your area allow for them.Many cities have implemented rules on keeping backyard
poultry and do not allow roosters. A straight run purchase of
chicks should be avoided in this case and only pullets should
be purchased.
Biosecurity refers to procedures implemented to protect
animals from disease-causing pathogens to help keep them
healthy. One of the biggest aspects of raising chickens, or any
type of livestock, is to make sure that biosecurity protocols are
followed closely. Chickens should be purchased free of any
disease to avoid introducing a disease into your existing flock. It
is best to purchase similar age birds from a similar species at
one time. Avoid purchasing poultry from unknown sources. Do
not bring a bird into your flock if you do not know its prior health
record. The Animal Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture has a fact sheet to reference on
biosecurity. The fact sheet is available by searching for USDA poultry biosecurity.
To help biosecurity, the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) was developed in the 1930s with the
mission to eradicate a number of major poultry diseases such as pullorum, salmonella, mycoplasma, and avian
influenza. Breeders that are members are required to have their birds tested for pullorum-typhoid and be
vaccinated against Marek’s disease. It is critical when purchasing chickens to only buy birds certified free of
NPIP diseases. Starting with healthy chicks is paramount to having a healthy flock. According to the Ohio
Poultry Association, the following Ohio hatcheries comply with NPIP regulations: Eagle Nest Poultry, Mey</p>
